# Predicting NBA Injuries 

At Insight, I decided to take a look at predicting NBA injuries. I collected data including injury reports on all the players who played at NBA between 2010 and 2018 by scrapping NBA databases. I spent a lot of time understanding, cleaning, analyzing and engineering the data. I built a web app that inputs a player's BMI, age, position, number of years played and history of past injuries from year N-8 to year N-1 and outputs the risk of injury at year N. 

The web app can be found at: https://court-report.herokuapp.com/

The code is presented in a jupyter notebook: NBA_injuries_prediction.ipython

This reposetory also includes all the files I needed to create the app on Heroku using flask.
