# Predicting NBA Knee Injuries 

At Insight, I decided to take a shot at predicting knee injuries in NBA. I collected data including injury reports on all the players who played in NBA between 2010 and 2018 by scrapping NBA databases. I spent a lot of time understanding, cleaning, analyzing the data and engineering features. I built a web app that inputs a player's weight, height, age, position, number of years played and the history of the past knee injuries from year N-8 to year N-1 and outputs the risk of the knee injury in year N. The app's predictions are 2.5x more accurate than random guess. This reposetory includes all the files I created to build the web app on Heroku using Flask as the final deliverable of my Insight project.

The web app can be found at: https://court-report.herokuapp.com/

The code is presented in the following jupyter notebook: NBA_injuries_prediction.ipynb 

FinalDemo.pdf is the pdf version of the project demo.
